A very simple implementation of the KNN algorithm using the Euclidean Distance to calculate the nearest neighbor. Used to classify values based on 2D features.

To change value of K, change it directly in the source code, at "Home.py, line 18".

To run the application, first open the project folder on a command terminal and install the required packages using "pip install -r requirements.txt", then run "streamlit run Home.py".
